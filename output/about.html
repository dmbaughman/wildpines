	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>My name is Annie, and I specialize in mental health counseling for youth and adolescents. I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Therapeutic Recreation from Western Washington University in 2006, and a dual Master's in School and Community Counseling from Washington State University in 2010. I have experience counseling youth in both school and community settings. I have worked as a wilderness therapist, career counselor, challenge course facilitator, and in an acute inpatient psychiatric hospital.</p>
	<p>I have always been passionate about working with youth and fully believe in the healing nature of a wilderness experience.  I have always loved the wilderness.  I find that there is something inexplicable and fulfilling about interacting with nature.  Backpacking is a passion of mine, and I began backpacking at the age of five.  One of my earliest memories is of celebrating my 5th birthday on a backpacking trip with my family.  I remember waking up to the sound of birds chirping and the sight of a few small balloons tied to the tent that my mother had packed in, just for my birthday.</p>
	<p>While earning my undergraduate degree in Recreation, I learned the value of play and its role as an essential component of well-being.  Through experiential activities, people learn, grow, and challenge themselves physically, mentally, socially and emotionally.  I encourage youth and their families to connect with nature and bring their experiences back to the counseling office.</p>
	<p>I bring my passion for the wilderness and adventure into my counseling practice.  By helping youth connect with nature, I can help them connect with themselves.  I combine traditional therapeutic techniques and counseling theories with adventure and animal-assisted therapy.  Gryphon, my partner in counseling, is a 4-year-old Brittany Spaniel who is a registered therapy dog.  He embodies unconditional love and acceptance, wrapped in a fur coat.</p>
